1. puts returns "nil" and prints the output to the console with a new line.
2. Integers are whole numbers that cannot return decimal points. A float is a number with decimal points.
3. The difference between float and integer division is that float can return decimal points while integers cannot. For example if you divide 9 / 2 in ruby, it will output 4 because it is the arithmetic of that division.

puts 24 * 365
puts 525949 * 10
