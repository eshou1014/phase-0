1. puts returns "nil" and prints the output to the console with a new line.
2. Integers are whole numbers that cannot return decimal points. A float is a number with decimal points.
3. The difference between float and integer division is that float can return decimal points while integers cannot. For example if you divide 9 / 2 in ruby, it will output 4 because it is the arithmetic of that division.

puts 24 * 365
puts 525949 * 10

1. Ruby handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers by using integers/floats and uses the " + - * /" to do math and calculate answers.
2. Integers are numbers without decimal points and floats are numbers with decimal points.
3. The difference between float and integer division is that float can return decimal points while integers cannot. For example if you divide 9 / 2 in ruby, it will output 4 because it is the arithmetic of that division.
4. Strings are groups of letters in a program. You use them to have your program communicate language to the user. You can use them whenever, but the most useful is inputting new information regarding characters and not numbers.
5. Local variables are numbers or letters that store information. You use them when you want your variable to 'point' to a string/number.
6. This challenge was simple. It was a great review of all the basic stuff that I learned before.
