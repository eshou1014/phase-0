A one-to-one database is when both entities are a pair. They cannot exist without the other.

You would use a one-to-one database when you needed to query a single relationship between two entities.

A many-to-many databse is when there are groups of something that need to be kept track of for performing multiple tasks.

You would use a many-to-many when you needed to create a database that has a lot of groups keeping track of their capabilities.

The most confusing thing about schemas is what info I need to put inside the tables. I understand the one-to-one and many-to-many but not fully.
